# America's Battleground | The Cold War Sacrifice of Argentina

## TL;DR

The "Dirty War" occurred during the height of the Cold War. In this context,
Argentina was allowed to devolve into chaos because the ideals of the military
dictatorship aligned with the United States' political agenda.

## The Article

The first article in this series establishes that the US knew about Argentina's
political environment and the inevitability of a military takeover, a coup
d'état. US agents were already monitoring guerrilla activities and the steady
increase in anti-leftist efforts. However, the US awareness of the upcoming
coup does not explain the lack of meaningful intervention. To do so, the "Dirty
War" must be considered in the broader geopolitical context of the Cold War.

What was the Cold War? Some of us remember it as our childhood, so I do not
need to define it here; you lived through it. Nevertheless, I will give a brief
overview for those unfamiliar. The Cold War was an indirect ideological
conflict between the United States' capitalism and the Soviet Union's
communism. US foreign policy during this period was less about promoting
democratic and capitalist views and more about containing and eradicating
communist ones [1](#bibliography). Why is Argentina important in this context? It is
because the "Dirty War" was a metaphorical proving ground for these conflicting
ideals. In addition, the US viewed political instability as a threat to
capitalism, where communism could take hold. For this reason, right-wing
authoritarian regimes, like the one during the "Dirty War," promised control
and security against the communist ideals.

Argentina's political crisis unfolded within this framework. After the military
coup in March 1976, the country came under a military dictatorship led by
General Jorge Rafael Videla. To Videla, the road to restoring national unity
came through repression and fear. Under Videla, forced disappearances, torture
one beyond recognition, and extrajudicial murders were justified as measures
against leftist subversion. These actions, blatant human rights violations,
were both common and conspicuous to the public [2](#bibliography). Recently
declassified US documents reveal that the Americans were aware of the methods
employed by Videla and his regime as well as his justification for these
actions. While political violence contributed to the instability of Argentina
before the coup, it was later used "as a rationale for a no-holds-barred
approach to counter-terrorism," resulting in "egregious violations of human
rights, despite public recognition by the government that the terrorists have
been largely defeated" [3](#bibliography). While the US officials recognized the
severity of the actions that occurred under Videla, there was no action to
remedy this situation. This reflected the political agenda of the US, where
security against communism was more important than preserving human rights in a
foreign nation. Even in the quote above, the issue is framed in terms of the
counterterrorism movement against leftist sentiments.

This declassified document and the resulting analysis reveal how the US' Cold
War priorities twisted the perception of Argentinian violence under Videla's
dictatorship. For the "Dirty War," awareness did not lead to intervention;
instead, brutality and human rights concerns were swept under the rug in favor
of an ideological defense against communism. Argentina became the battleground
of Cold War ideologies not because the US intervened, but because they did
_not_. The US allowed Argentina to devolve into chaos, where terror and torture
were not just permissible but commonplace, all for their own political and
ideological agenda.
