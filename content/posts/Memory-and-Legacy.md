# End of the Terror | Memory, Declassification, and the Legacy of Argentina's "Dirty War"

## TL;DR

Even after the "Dirty War" ended, its effects can still be felt. The
remembrance of the atrocities committed is distorted by the United States'
sanitization. While the declassified CIA documents help shine light on the
events of the "Dirty War," they also demonstrate the controlled narrative about
US involvement that was pushed.

## The Article

This is it! This is the last article in my series on the Argentinian "Dirty
War." Throughout this series, we have outlined a clear pattern in the
relationship between the United States and Argentina. This pattern includes
inaction despite knowledge of an imminent coup d'état, the overarching Cold War
political atmosphere that prioritized ideological alignment over human rights,
and a narrative that sanitizes repression through euphemisms and silence.
However, the consequences of these decisions did not magically dissipate after
the collapse of the dictatorship in 1983. To this day, they shape our
understanding of the "Dirty War" and how it is remembered, both in Argentina as
well as in the United States.

Memory is not a passive process. It weaves together narratives and events of
the past, the voices of those involved, and the material evidence of their
existence. In Argentina, the transition out of the dictatorship into a
democracy was accompanied by a focused effort to remember and acknowledge the
past. The creation of CONADEP (the National Commission on the Disappearance of
Persons) commemorates this attempt to acknowledge and document the period of
state terror. To ensure those that were persecuted are not forgotten, Nunca Mas
catalogued the forced disappearances, tortures, and extrajudicial murders in
1984, offering surviving family members' and friends' testimonials of these
individuals to counteract the years of denial and repression. This began the
reframing of the "Dirty War," not as a legitimate persecution of
counterterrorist ideals in the name of national security, but as the systematic
persecution of a nation's own people through structured violence and human
rights atrocities.

Simultaneously, movements such as Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo challenge the
silence though public memory. By marching weekly and demanding information
about their disappeared children, they resisted the narrative imposed upon them
by the military regime and its attempts to erase their loved ones from history.
This highlights that memory does not rely upon consensus, but in the diversity
of courageous voices willing to speak out against the consensus.

In the United States however, the legacy of the "Dirty War" is presented
differently. For decades, US officials refused to acknowledge US involvement or
knowledge of the situation in Argentina, keeping it fragmented and inaccessible
to the public. While the CIA and other intelligence agencies suppressed the
information about the "Dirty War" in real time, the records of this
sanitization were kept hidden from the public eye. As a result, the public
memory of the "Dirty War" and its violence slipped through the cracks of
American responsibility and awareness.

Once these classified documents began to be released from the late 1990s into
the 2010s, this perception started to shift. Thousands of documents were
released, revealing the US involvement and permission of human rights
violations, forced disappearances, and acknowledgment of the military regime's
justification for the repression. These released documents did not change what
the Argentinian survivors already knew, but it confirmed that the US willfully
ignored the situation.

Historians like Carlos Osorio have argued that declassification serves two
purposes: it enforces accountability while also exposing the limitations of
delayed transparency. Documents released decades after the event cannot prevent
atrocities, but it can give them context.

These records help demonstrate how narrative shapes memory. As shown through
the many articles given previously, US officials consistently describe the
Argentinian repression using sanitized and politically correct language, such
as countersubversion and stability control efforts. This kind of language
influences how historians and readers reflect on the past. Even when documents
acknowledge the torture and forced disappearances, the emotional toll of these
events is dampened by the professional tone. The CIA archive itself is where
the violence of Videla and the regime is simultaneously revealed and obscured.

These issues of censorship, sanitization, and silence extend beyond Argentina.
The "Dirty War" serves as a case study in the power of state-controlled
information over the public. By controlling the language used to communicate
the Argentinian situation, delaying the declassification and spread of this
information, and prioritizing the geopolitical agenda during the Cold War, the
United States shaped both the physical events that occurred and the historical
record of them afterward. In this framework, memory acts as an extension of US
policy.

However, memory is dynamic. There are ongoing trials of regime officials in
Argentina, revitalized public discussion, and continued discovery of archived
information that challenges this controlled narrative. Each document that is
disclosed to the public breaks the silence of those who suffered under the
military regime, forcing a reevaluation of the responsibility that the US held
in the "Dirty War." In this way, the past remains fluid and ever changing,
refusing to slip into obscurity.

From this, the legacy of the "Dirty War" is not only one marred by terror and
desperate survival, but also of challenged remembrance. It consistently raises
questions for all powerful nations, namely the responsibility for action in the
face of known tyrannical behavior. Who is responsible for the tens of thousands
of lives extinguished during the authoritarian reign of Videla and his regime?
And how is this story preserved or suppressed through the narratives of the
public?

By following the influence that the US had on the "Dirty War," from
foreknowledge of the imminent coup to the Cold War justifications and narrative
control, this series argues that the United States was not merely a bystander
in Argentina's struggle. They were willing to turn a blind eye to a nation
tumbling into chaos and immorality because it fit into their political
narrative and objectives. The memory and remembrance of this does not dismiss
the responsibility of the US; rather it exposes their complacency. The
lingering question is whether the acknowledgment of Argentina's past will spur
accountability, or whether silence will once again triumph.

Thank you all for joining me in this series. Until next time.
