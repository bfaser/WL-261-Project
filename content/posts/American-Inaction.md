# American Action -and Inaction- before Argentina's Coup d'État

## TL;DR

The US knew about the political crisis unfolding in Argentina prior to the
"Dirty War", where violence and human rights violations started to become
widespread. Despite this, they refused to offer aid.


## The Article

Leading up to the military coup d'état that ushered in Argentina's "Dirty War",
the country dealt with significant political instability. From 1930 to 1976
(the beginning of the "Dirty War"), Argentina experienced roughly 9 coups and
more than 20 different political leaders <sup>[1](#bibliography)</sup>. During this, leftist
groups were banding together for guerrilla warfare. These guerrilla groups
robbed and stole "Robin Hood-style", stealing from the rich and giving to the
poor <sup>[1](#bibliography)</sup>. By the 1970s, Argentina's instability-shaped by lingering
World War II ideologies and intensifying Cold War tensions-caught the attention
of the United States.  In fact, the US had already stationed intelligence
operatives throughout Argentina, monitoring the political climate. On July 2,
1975, US officials in Argentina reported terrorist plans from the Argentine
People's Revolutionary Army (ERP), one of the guerrilla groups mentioned
earlier. They reported concerns that the ERP planned to kidnap US officials and
attack their embassy in Buenos Aires <sup>[2](#bibliography)</sup>. While
they only reported concerns for the US officials, it highlights Argentina's
rising instability and the US' awareness of it.

In another declassified document, the US discussed the persecution of leftist
groups throughout Latin America. The report starts with the statement about the
political atmosphere, commenting on the known violation of human rights
<sup>[2](#bibliography)</sup>. This shows that the US fully knew of the things
occurring in Argentina.  Following this, the focus shifts to Argentina's
"legal" persecution of leftist sympathizers.  The document hints that the
government was overturning exiles in favor of execution, outside the law. These
points emphasize the instability of Latin America as a whole, with Argentina
leading the charge <sup>[2](#bibliography)</sup>. It shows that the US knew of
the war crimes and inhumane actions that culminated in the "Dirty War."

Together, these documents show that the US was not a bystander in Argentina's
political collapse, but an observer with a clear view of the nation's descent
into violence. The US intelligence agents documented the guerrilla activity,
predicted the military repression, and acknowledged the rising political
persecution of the left. Despite this, they decided neither to intervene nor
offer aid. The US minimized the suffering of the Argentinian people, shown by
the nonchalant mentions of the human rights abuses. As the tensions of the Cold
War escalated, the situation in Argentina was seen not as a humanitarian crisis
but as a strategic battle for ideological supremacy. By choosing to observe
rather than intervene, the United States facilitated the conditions necessary
for repression to spread unchecked. In the next article, we will explore how
the Cold War and the US' tactical agenda made the refusal of aid not just
acceptable but politically advantageous.
