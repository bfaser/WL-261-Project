# Argentina's "Dirty War"

The "Dirty War" is the period between 1976 and 1983 when Argentina was ruled by
an authoritarian military dictatorship. The term "Dirty War," Guerra Sucia in
Spanish, describing this period in Argentinian history is often rejected by
human rights groups today, as it implies the notion of justified and
necessitated action amid war. This implication, that war was underway in
Argentina, is entirely false; The "Dirty War" describes the systematic
persecution of Argentinian citizens by their own government, using unlawful and
cruel methods. General Rafael Videla, the dictator during the "Dirty War,"
persecuted his own people using terrorist tactics including abduction, torture,
and murder. <sup>[1,5](#bibliography)</sup>. Even today, the effects of this period
can be felt. Very little literature and evidence exist today from this period
because of the fearmongering and censorship enacted by the Argentinian
leadership <sup>[1](#bibliography)</sup>. While many of the primary perpetrators of this
horrific event have been tried under the current Argentinian judicial system,
many still feel that proper justice has not been served. As Sam Furguson writes
in his book The Disappeared: Remnants of a Dirty War, "But the trial is as much
about the 'symbols of the dictatorship' who created an 'Argentine Auschwitz' as
it is about the individual crimes enumerated in the charging papers" <sup>[1](#bibliography)</sup>.

In the 50 years leading up to the "Dirty War," Argentina experienced nine
military coups and the oversight of more than twenty different political
leaders between 1930 and 1976 <sup>[5](#bibliography)</sup>. This period of substantial
political instability spans all of World War II and extends into a significant
portion of the Cold War. While Argentina remained neutral throughout the
majority of WWII, it was the location of refuge for many sympathizers of Nazi
Germany. These refugees brought with them anti-Semitic sentiments, further
contributing to Argentina's instability. In the aftermath of World War II, the
Cold War arose between the United States and the Soviet Union. The primary
cause for this conflict was the ideological incompatibility between the Soviet
communism and the American capitalism <sup>[2](#bibliography)</sup>. In this context, Argentina
was used as a proving ground for these competing ideas.

In September 1975, a proposition was passed under the guise of opposing the
leftist guerrilla threat, directing the military to eradicate "subversion"
<sup>[5](#bibliography)</sup>. With this proposition, the military expanded its anti-leftist
efforts to the point of terrorism. These actions were conducted to eliminate
anti-capitalist ideals that had been circulating and had caused the initial
guerrilla attacks. Contributing to this hostile and tumultuous environment were
the remnants of World War II ideals. Argentina harbored a vast number of Jews
who immigrated over the century leading up to the outbreak of the "Dirty War."
Following the conclusion of WWII, sympathizers of Nazi Germany brought with
them their anti-Semitic sentiments that resonated with the extreme right-wing.
This religious tension and continuation of World War II ideological differences
led to the Jews and leftists being scapegoats for any problem Argentina faced
<sup>[5](#bibliography)</sup>. In this light, Jacobo Timerman, a prisoner of the Argentinian
dictatorship, summarized the mindset of the leadership as the following: "World
War III had begun; the enemy was left-wing terrorism; and Argentina was the
initial battleground chosen by the enemy." <sup>[5](#bibliography)</sup>.

Prior to the military takeover that ushered in the "Dirty War," political
instability in Argentina reached a breaking point as leftist groups conducted
guerrilla attacks across the country. These leftist warriors attacked "Robin
Hood-style," stealing food and other necessities to distribute in impoverished
areas in hopes of raising public support <sup>[5](#bibliography)</sup>. Nearing 1970, the
attacks from the left became directed towards military personnel and
right-leaning politicians. Fearing another world war, José López Rega though
the Argentinian president at the time, Juan D. Perón, formed the Alianza
Anticommunista Argentina (or Argentine Anticommunist Alliance, AAA) to
neutralize the leftist action <sup>[5](#bibliography)</sup>. The AAA was a "death squad"
<sup>[5](#bibliography)</sup> sanctioned by the president to eliminate the leftist
insurrectionists, or anyone harboring ideology different than capitalism. It
also laid the foundation for the "Dirty War," as the violence sharply increase
in the year following. In July 1974, the AAA drastically increased its activity
and ferocity against the left's terrorism following Perón's death. As a result,
support for the Argentinian leadership dwindled until the military coup d'état
on March 24, 1976 <sup>[5](#bibliography)</sup>.

This military coup on March 24, considered necessary due to the excessive AAA
violence and their terroristic methods, sought to restore order and structure
to Argentina. The first program proposed to remedy the situation Argentina
faced was El Processo de Reorgananización Nacional (The Process of National
Reorganization) <sup>[5](#bibliography)</sup>. It proposed the swift and decisive
eradication of those opposing the new leadership, so that order could be
reinstated. With this, the Argentinian military had complete control over the
nation and all its inhabitants <sup>[5](#bibliography)</sup>. Within months, the military
dictatorship was persecuting and heavily suppressing the Argentinian public.
The approach was order through overwhelming terror, where no one would dare
oppose the leadership. In a speech to the public, the figurehead of the
dictatorship, Rafael Videla, spoke on imposing justice and reaffirming liberty.
Taken in conjunction with his speech months earlier where he expressed his
willingness to protect the nation no matter the cost, Videla forbode a grim and
bloody future to come <sup>[5](#bibliography)</sup>. With this, Videla ushered in the
"Dirty War" of Argentina.

The "Dirty War" was characterized by the Argentinian dictatorship using state
terror to suppress political dissidence and maintain control. Instead of solely
relying upon legal measures for unifying the nation, the military dictatorship
chose to make use of extralegal, clandestine repression. As Thomas C. Wright
explains, the leadership justified its actions as necessary to combat the
subversion from the left. This justification enabled the dictatorship to commit
numerous human rights violations, including but not limited to abductions,
torture, and murder <sup>[5](#bibliography)</sup>. This violence was used to intimidate the
Argentinian people into submission and eliminate any semblance of political
opposition.

One extralegal repression tactic used by the military dictatorship extensively
during the "Dirty War" to rid the nation of any perceived threats was forced
disappearance. These forced disappearances include the kidnapping, exile, and
murder of Argentinian citizens. Tens of thousands of Argentinians were abducted
by the military, with 62% happening in the dead of night and witnessed by
another. There was nothing secretive about these disappearances. In fact, the
Argentinian officials would deliberately call attention to themselves to
amplify the terror felt by those nearby <sup>[5](#bibliography)</sup>. Once abducted, the
victims were taken to the Argentinian equivalent of concentration camps, the
location of which was and still is unknown. These camps were deliberately
concealed to further enhance the fear felt by neighbors and loved ones, who had
no way of knowing whether the individual was alive <sup>[1](#bibliography)</sup>. An estimated
380 of these concentration camps were scattered throughout Argentina, sometimes
in plain sight. As former prisoner recounts, "I could hear people walking by
cars and buses passing, life going on as usual, with us disappeared in a
concentration camp. We were in the world but not part of it, alive in the realm
of death" <sup>[5](#bibliography)</sup>.

The dictatorship would justify these actions as only occurring to leftist
dissidents and threats to the stability of Argentina, although the definition
of "leftist dissident" had expanded throughout the "Dirty War."  Students,
journalists, intellectuals, and anyone suspected of harboring dissident
intentions was now included under the umbrella of "left dissidence"
<sup>[5](#bibliography)</sup>. Marguerite Feitlowitz emphasizes that language itself was a
tool of repression used by the military, using euphemisms and other verbiage to
obscure their actions and further dehumanize the victims <sup>[3](#bibliography)</sup>.
These atrocities were permissible under the authoritarian regime of military
dictatorship, as the definition of "subversive action" was vague. This
manipulation of the definition facilitated and normalized the violence
committed by the military.

Beyond physical means of controlling and suppressing the Argentinian
population, the military regime made extensive use of fear. Sam Ferguson
describes the universal presence of forced disappearance altering the social
atmosphere, seeding distrust within communities, and encouraging silence and
self-censorship for fear of being another victim <sup>[4](#bibliography)</sup>. The military
dictatorship was able to easily maintain extreme level of fear and terrorism
because the Argentinian people were self-policing and self-censoring, too
afraid of becoming next among the disappeared.

The effects of these atrocities can be felt today and shape the narrative
around Argentinian history. Although democracy was instated in 1983 and many of
the state-sanctioned terrorists persecuted, there are lingering questions of
proper justice, accountability, and remembrance. Brennan remarks that the
absence of physical evidence and trauma inflicted upon the surviving victims
complicates the recovery from this event, both nationally and individually
<sup>[1](#bibliography)</sup>. Acknowledging the mechanisms by which the Argentinian
military was able to instate petrifying fear on a national level, as well as
the consequences of the extreme oppression felt by the Argentinian people, is
essential to understanding Argentinian history and recognizing the long-term
effects of state-sponsored terrorism on a society.
