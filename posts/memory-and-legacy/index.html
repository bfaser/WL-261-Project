The remembrance of the atrocities committed is distorted by the United States' sanitization. While the declassified CIA documents help shine light on the events of the "Dirty War," they also demonstrate the controlled narrative about US involvement that was pushed.<h2 id=the-article>The Article<a aria-hidden=true class=anchor hidden href=#the-article>#</a></h2><p>This is it! This is the last article in my series on the Argentinian "Dirty War." Throughout this series, we have outlined a clear pattern in the relationship between the United States and Argentina. This pattern includes inaction despite knowledge of an imminent coup d'état, the overarching Cold War political atmosphere that prioritized ideological alignment over human rights, and a narrative that sanitizes repression through euphemisms and silence. However, the consequences of these decisions did not magically dissipate after the collapse of the dictatorship in 1983. To this day, they shape our understanding of the "Dirty War" and how it is remembered, both in Argentina as well as in the United States.<p>Memory is not a passive process. It weaves together narratives and events of the past, the voices of those involved, and the material evidence of their existence. In Argentina, the transition out of the dictatorship into a democracy was accompanied by a focused effort to remember and acknowledge the past. The creation of CONADEP (the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons) commemorates this attempt to acknowledge and document the period of state terror. To ensure those that were persecuted are not forgotten, Nunca Mas catalogued the forced disappearances, tortures, and extrajudicial murders in 1984, offering surviving family members' and friends' testimonials of these individuals to counteract the years of denial and repression. This began the reframing of the "Dirty War," not as a legitimate persecution of counterterrorist ideals in the name of national security, but as the systematic persecution of a nation's own people through structured violence and human rights atrocities.<p>Simultaneously, movements such as Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo challenge the silence though public memory. By marching weekly and demanding information about their disappeared children, they resisted the narrative imposed upon them by the military regime and its attempts to erase their loved ones from history. This highlights that memory does not rely upon consensus, but in the diversity of courageous voices willing to speak out against the consensus.<p>In the United States however, the legacy of the "Dirty War" is presented differently. For decades, US officials refused to acknowledge US involvement or knowledge of the situation in Argentina, keeping it fragmented and inaccessible to the public. While the CIA and other intelligence agencies suppressed the information about the "Dirty War" in real time, the records of this sanitization were kept hidden from the public eye. As a result, the public memory of the "Dirty War" and its violence slipped through the cracks of American responsibility and awareness.<p>Once these classified documents began to be released from the late 1990s into the 2010s, this perception started to shift. Thousands of documents were released, revealing the US involvement and permission of human rights violations, forced disappearances, and acknowledgment of the military regime's justification for the repression. These released documents did not change what the Argentinian survivors already knew, but it confirmed that the US willfully ignored the situation.<p>Historians like Carlos Osorio have argued that declassification serves two purposes: it enforces accountability while also exposing the limitations of delayed transparency. Documents released decades after the event cannot prevent atrocities, but it can give them context.<p>These records help demonstrate how narrative shapes memory. As shown through the many articles given previously, US officials consistently describe the Argentinian repression using sanitized and politically correct language, such as countersubversion and stability control efforts. This kind of language influences how historians and readers reflect on the past. Even when documents acknowledge the torture and forced disappearances, the emotional toll of these events is dampened by the professional tone. The CIA archive itself is where the violence of Videla and the regime is simultaneously revealed and obscured.<p>These issues of censorship, sanitization, and silence extend beyond Argentina. The "Dirty War" serves as a case study in the power of state-controlled information over the public. By controlling the language used to communicate the Argentinian situation, delaying the declassification and spread of this information, and prioritizing the geopolitical agenda during the Cold War, the United States shaped both the physical events that occurred and the historical record of them afterward. In this framework, memory acts as an extension of US policy.<p>However, memory is dynamic. There are ongoing trials of regime officials in Argentina, revitalized public discussion, and continued discovery of archived information that challenges this controlled narrative. Each document that is disclosed to the public breaks the silence of those who suffered under the military regime, forcing a reevaluation of the responsibility that the US held in the "Dirty War." In this way, the past remains fluid and ever changing, refusing to slip into obscurity.<p>From this, the legacy of the "Dirty War" is not only one marred by terror and desperate survival, but also of challenged remembrance. It consistently raises questions for all powerful nations, namely the responsibility for action in the face of known tyrannical behavior. Who is responsible for the tens of thousands of lives extinguished during the authoritarian reign of Videla and his regime? And how is this story preserved or suppressed through the narratives of the public?<p>By following the influence that the US had on the "Dirty War," from foreknowledge of the imminent coup to the Cold War justifications and narrative control, this series argues that the United States was not merely a bystander in Argentina's struggle. They were willing to turn a blind eye to a nation tumbling into chaos and immorality because it fit into their political narrative and objectives. The memory and remembrance of this does not dismiss the responsibility of the US; rather it exposes their complacency. The lingering question is whether the acknowledgment of Argentina's past will spur accountability, or whether silence will once again triumph.<p>Thank you all for joining me in this series.
