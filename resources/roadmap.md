# Roadmap for Project 2

## Series Overview

Welcome! (or welcome back, if you have visited previously :smile!) We will be
starting a new series on Argentina's \"Dirty War\" (1976 - 1983). If you are
unfamiliar with this period in Argentinian history, you can reference [this
wonderful article](@/posts/Dirty-War.md)(written by yours truly!). And don't
worry, I will recap important events as they come up in the articles.

This series explores American intervention-or their deliberate
non-intervention-in Argentina's "Dirty War," arguing that U.S. inaction created
the conditions in which state repression escalated into widespread terror and
human rights violations.

## Article 1: American Action - and Inaction - before Argentina's Coup d'État

## TL;DR
The US knew about the political crisis unfolding in Argentina prior to the
"Dirty War", where violence and human rights violations started to become
widespread. Despite this, they refused to offer aid.

## The Article

Leading up to the military coup d'état that ushered in Argentina's "Dirty War",
the country dealt with significant political instability. From 1930 to 1976
(the beginning of the "Dirty War"), Argentina experienced roughly 9 coups and
more than 20 different political leaders (Wright 119). During this, leftist
groups were banding together for guerrilla warfare. These guerrilla groups
robbed and stole "Robin Hood-style", stealing from the rich and giving to the
poor (Wright 121). By the 1970s, Argentina's instability-shaped by lingering
World War II ideologies and intensifying Cold War tensions-caught the attention
of the United States.  In fact, the US had already stationed intelligence
operatives throughout Argentina, monitoring the political climate. On July 2,
1975, US officials in Argentina reported terrorist plans from the Argentine
People's Revolutionary Army (ERP), one of the guerrilla groups mentioned
earlier. They reported concerns that the ERP planned to kidnap US officials and
attack their embassy in Buenos Aires (Meeting of Leftist Terrorists). While
they only reported concerns for the US officials, it highlights Argentina's
rising instability and the US' awareness of it.

In another declassified document, the US discussed the persecution of leftist
groups throughout Latin America. The report starts with the statement about the
political atmosphere, commenting on the known violation of human rights
(National Intelligence Daily). This shows that the US fully knew of the things
occurring in Argentina.  Following this, the focus shifts to Argentina's
"legal" persecution of leftist sympathizers.  The document hints that the
government was overturning exiles in favor of execution, outside the law. These
points emphasize the instability of Latin America as a whole, with Argentina
leading the charge (National Intelligence Daily). It shows that the US knew of
the war crimes and inhumane actions that culminated in the "Dirty War."

Together, these documents show that the US was not a bystander in Argentina's
political collapse, but an observer with a clear view of the nation's descent
into violence. The US intelligence agents documented the guerrilla activity,
predicted the military repression, and acknowledged the rising political
persecution of the left. Despite this, they decided neither to intervene nor
offer aid. The US minimized the suffering of the Argentinian people, shown by
the nonchalant mentions of the human rights abuses. As the tensions of the Cold
War escalated, the situation in Argentina was seen not as a humanitarian crisis
but as a strategic battle for ideological supremacy. By choosing to observe
rather than intervene, the United States facilitated the conditions necessary
for repression to spread unchecked. In the next article, we will explore how
the Cold War and the US' tactical agenda made the refusal of aid not just
acceptable but politically advantageous.


## Article 2: America's Battleground: The Cold War Sacrifice of Argentina

## TL;DR

The "Dirty War" occurred during the height of the Cold War. In this context,
Argentina was allowed to devolve into chaos because the ideals of the military
dictatorship aligned with the United States' political agenda.

## The Article

The first article in this series establishes that the US knew about Argentina's
political environment and the inevitability of a military takeover, a coup
d'état. US agents were already monitoring guerrilla activities and the steady
increase in anti-leftist efforts. However, the US awareness of the upcoming
coup does not explain the lack of meaningful intervention. To do so, the "Dirty
War" must be considered in the broader geopolitical context of the Cold War.

What was the Cold War? Some of us remember it as our childhood, so I do not
need to define it here; you lived through it. Nevertheless, I will give a brief
overview for those unfamiliar. The Cold War was an indirect ideological
conflict between the United States' capitalism and the Soviet Union's
communism. US foreign policy during this period was less about promoting
democratic and capitalist views and more about containing and eradicating
communist ones (Britannica). Why is Argentina important in this context? It is
because the "Dirty War" was a metaphorical proving ground for these conflicting
ideals. In addition, the US viewed political instability as a threat to
capitalism, where communism could take hold. For this reason, right-wing
authoritarian regimes, like the one during the "Dirty War," promised control
and security against the communist ideals.

Argentina's political crisis unfolded within this framework. After the military
coup in March 1976, the country came under a military dictatorship led by
General Jorge Rafael Videla. To Videla, the road to restoring national unity
came through repression and fear. Under Videla, forced disappearances, torture
one beyond recognition, and extrajudicial murders were justified as measures
against leftist subversion. These actions, blatant human rights violations,
were both common and conspicuous to the public (Wright 124-127). Recently
declassified US documents reveal that the Americans were aware of the methods
employed by Videla and his regime as well as his justification for these
actions. While political violence contributed to the instability of Argentina
before the coup, it was later used "as a rationale for a no-holds-barred
approach to counter-terrorism," resulting in "egregious violations of human
rights, despite public recognition by the government that the terrorists have
been largely defeated" (Carter Report 9). While the US officials recognized the
severity of the actions that occurred under Videla, there was no action to
remedy this situation. This reflected the political agenda of the US, where
security against communism was more important than preserving human rights in a
foreign nation. Even in the quote above, the issue is framed in terms of the
counterterrorism movement against leftist sentiments.

This declassified document and the resulting analysis reveal how the US' Cold
War priorities twisted the perception of Argentinian violence under Videla's
dictatorship. For the "Dirty War," awareness did not lead to intervention;
instead, brutality and human rights concerns were swept under the rug in favor
of an ideological defense against communism. Argentina became the battleground
of Cold War ideologies not because the US intervened, but because they did
_not_. The US allowed Argentina to devolve into chaos, where terror and torture
were not just permissible but commonplace, all for their own political and
ideological agenda.

This framework did not merely justify inaction. It influenced how events are
narrated and which voices are silenced. In the next article, we will explore
how the American narrative, through censorship, sanitization, and silence,
further obscures the effects of the "Dirty War" for the American audience.


## Article 3: The American Narrative: Censorship, Sanitization, and Silence

## TL;DR

US intelligence heavily censored and sanitized the events of the "Dirty War"
within their own circles and to the general public. Because of this, the
atrocities committed in a faraway nation became tolerable. The public did not
know the full extent to which the Argentinian government was terrorizing its
own people.

## The Article

In the previous article, we looked at how Cold War ideologies and tensions
shaped the US' attitude towards Argentina's "Dirty War," framing the
Argentinian repression as a geopolitical struggle against communism rather than
a series of human rights violations. The US not only understood the logic
driving the military regime, but anticipated it. Despite this, the US decided
not to intervene. This refusal to intervene also shaped the way information
concerning the situation was communicated, both within the CIA as well as the
general American public. In other words, not only did the US refuse to
intervene, they also tightly controlled how the narrative was told.

Declassified CIA documents reveal that US officials were highly aware of the
importance that the spread of information had on Argentinian repression.
Videla's military regime did not rely upon force alone; it strove to suppress
and eliminate dissident voices using popular media. In one declassified US
document of President Carter's report on Argentina, the view of General Ramon
Camps, a senior Argentinian security official, warned that "parents, news,
media, and dissidents were corrupting the minds of young impressionable people"
(Carter Report 16). Here, the information itself is framed as a threat to the
public, rather than an asset.

This framing is critical to the successful repression of the Argentinian
people. By portraying journalists and dissidents as ideological enemies under
the same umbrella, the military regime justified censorship in the name of
national security. What's alarming is that US officials acknowledged this
reasoning without objection. The document neither challenges the statement made
by Camps, nor does it question the legitimacy of repressing the media. Instead,
Camps' recount of the justification is given in a neutral, matter-of-fact tone.
This tonality is widespread when reporting on the "Dirty War."

This tone and phrasing matters. As reports circulate within the CIA and other
US offices, repression by Videla's regime is described as countersubversion,
internal security, or for the benefit of the nation. The extreme acts of
violence, such as forced disappearances, tortures, and extralegal murders, are
acknowledged, but stripped of the emotional impact. This desensitizes and
sanitizes the narrative to minimize the cost of human lives from state violence
while preserving the geopolitical motivations behind it. This framing allowed
US policymakers and officials to tolerate the atrocities in a faraway nation
like Argentina without confronting their moral and ethical implications. 

The censorship within Argentina and the sanitization within US reporting
reinforced one another. As Argentinian journalists were silenced via
intimidation and violence, American intelligence briefings filled the missing
information with ideological justifications rather than the suppressed voices.
The awareness of Argentinian events remained, but the emotional impact did not.
The choice to minimize the narrative on the regime's victims allowed the "Dirty
War" to remain on the periphery of the US public's mind, even as evidence
continued to come in.

This selective narrative was not accidental. As the previous article stated,
the Cold War ideological tension encouraged the United States to view the mass
oppression in Argentina as a successful suppression of communist ideals. To
further entrench the public in this view, media sanitization was a logical
extension.  In accepting Videla's perspective of leftist ideology as
terroristic and violence as necessary, US officials contributed to an
environment where state terror and internal persecution were normalized and
commonplace.

Narrative controls how we understand, remember, respond, and take
responsibility for events. The next article will examine how this narrative
translates to the memory and legacy of the "Dirty War."

## Article 4: End of the Terror: Memory, Declassification, and the Legacy of Argentina's "Dirty War"

## TL;DR

Even after the "Dirty War" ended, its effects can still be felt. The
remembrance of the atrocities committed is distorted by the United States'
sanitization. While the declassified CIA documents help shine light on the
events of the "Dirty War," they also demonstrate the controlled narrative about
US involvement that was pushed.

## The Article

This is it! This is the last article in my series on the Argentinian "Dirty
War." Throughout this series, we have outlined a clear pattern in the
relationship between the United States and Argentina. This pattern includes
inaction despite knowledge of an imminent coup d'état, the overarching Cold War
political atmosphere that prioritized ideological alignment over human rights,
and a narrative that sanitizes repression through euphemisms and silence.
However, the consequences of these decisions did not magically dissipate after
the collapse of the dictatorship in 1983. To this day, they shape our
understanding of the "Dirty War" and how it is remembered, both in Argentina as
well as in the United States.

Memory is not a passive process. It weaves together narratives and events of
the past, the voices of those involved, and the material evidence of their
existence. In Argentina, the transition out of the dictatorship into a
democracy was accompanied by a focused effort to remember and acknowledge the
past. The creation of CONADEP (the National Commission on the Disappearance of
Persons) commemorates this attempt to acknowledge and document the period of
state terror. To ensure those that were persecuted are not forgotten, Nunca Mas
catalogued the forced disappearances, tortures, and extrajudicial murders in
1984, offering surviving family members' and friends' testimonials of these
individuals to counteract the years of denial and repression. This began the
reframing of the "Dirty War," not as a legitimate persecution of
counterterrorist ideals in the name of national security, but as the systematic
persecution of a nation's own people through structured violence and human
rights atrocities.

Simultaneously, movements such as Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo challenge the
silence though public memory. By marching weekly and demanding information
about their disappeared children, they resisted the narrative imposed upon them
by the military regime and its attempts to erase their loved ones from history.
This highlights that memory does not rely upon consensus, but in the diversity
of courageous voices willing to speak out against the consensus.

In the United States however, the legacy of the "Dirty War" is presented
differently. For decades, US officials refused to acknowledge US involvement or
knowledge of the situation in Argentina, keeping it fragmented and inaccessible
to the public. While the CIA and other intelligence agencies suppressed the
information about the "Dirty War" in real time, the records of this
sanitization were kept hidden from the public eye. As a result, the public
memory of the "Dirty War" and its violence slipped through the cracks of
American responsibility and awareness.

Once these classified documents began to be released from the late 1990s into
the 2010s, this perception started to shift. Thousands of documents were
released, revealing the US involvement and permission of human rights
violations, forced disappearances, and acknowledgment of the military regime's
justification for the repression. These released documents did not change what
the Argentinian survivors already knew, but it confirmed that the US willfully
ignored the situation.

Historians like Carlos Osorio have argued that declassification serves two
purposes: it enforces accountability while also exposing the limitations of
delayed transparency. Documents released decades after the event cannot prevent
atrocities, but it can give them context.

These records help demonstrate how narrative shapes memory. As shown through
the many articles given previously, US officials consistently describe the
Argentinian repression using sanitized and politically correct language, such
as countersubversion and stability control efforts. This kind of language
influences how historians and readers reflect on the past. Even when documents
acknowledge the torture and forced disappearances, the emotional toll of these
events is dampened by the professional tone. The CIA archive itself is where
the violence of Videla and the regime is simultaneously revealed and obscured.

These issues of censorship, sanitization, and silence extend beyond Argentina.
The "Dirty War" serves as a case study in the power of state-controlled
information over the public. By controlling the language used to communicate
the Argentinian situation, delaying the declassification and spread of this
information, and prioritizing the geopolitical agenda during the Cold War, the
United States shaped both the physical events that occurred and the historical
record of them afterward. In this framework, memory acts as an extension of US
policy.

However, memory is dynamic. There are ongoing trials of regime officials in
Argentina, revitalized public discussion, and continued discovery of archived
information that challenges this controlled narrative. Each document that is
disclosed to the public breaks the silence of those who suffered under the
military regime, forcing a reevaluation of the responsibility that the US held
in the "Dirty War." In this way, the past remains fluid and ever changing,
refusing to slip into obscurity.

From this, the legacy of the "Dirty War" is not only one marred by terror and
desperate survival, but also of challenged remembrance. It consistently raises
questions for all powerful nations, namely the responsibility for action in the
face of known tyrannical behavior. Who is responsible for the tens of thousands
of lives extinguished during the authoritarian reign of Videla and his regime?
And how is this story preserved or suppressed through the narratives of the
public?

By following the influence that the US had on the "Dirty War," from
foreknowledge of the imminent coup to the Cold War justifications and narrative
control, this series argues that the United States was not merely a bystander
in Argentina's struggle. They were willing to turn a blind eye to a nation
tumbling into chaos and immorality because it fit into their political
narrative and objectives. The memory and remembrance of this does not dismiss
the responsibility of the US; rather it exposes their complacency. The
lingering question is whether the acknowledgment of Argentina's past will spur
accountability, or whether silence will once again triumph.

Thank you all for joining me in this series. Until next time.
